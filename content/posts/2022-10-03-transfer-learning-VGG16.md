Transfer learning reuses a model built for an old task as the starting point for a new task.  In the article below, I predict pump cavitation with with 16,000 Hz accelerometer data.

The pre-trained VGG16 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was used as the starting point for transfer learning.  Citations are included at the end.
