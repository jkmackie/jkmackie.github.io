      <title>Transfer Learning with a One-Dimensional Signal</title>

      <description>This project predicts pump cavitation using 16,000 Hz accelerometer data (example below). This data can be automatically categorized by a model.
Transfer learning reuses a model built for an old task as the starting point for a new task. The pre-trained VGG16 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was the starting point. It categorizes images.
The original VGG16 was fine-tuned to categorize new images. The new images were derived from an accelerometer signal from the pump.</description>

      <description>On November 10, 2021, YouTube announced that video dislike ðŸ‘Ž counts would be hidden from the public. The stated benefit is protecting creators (especially smaller ones) from dislike attacks and harassment.
The number of dislikes is only available in YouTube Studio to content creators.
See the sentiment analysis below. It uses public comments scraped from the web and the DistillBERT language model.

      <description>The internet is a cesspool of spy bots. Bots can attack an internet server hundreds of times a day. This Jupyter notebook, written in Python, visualizes bot attacks. It uses my anonymized server log and IP address geolocation.
The illustration and code are here:
