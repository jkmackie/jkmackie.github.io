      <description>Transfer learning reuses a model built for an old task as the starting point for a new task. The pre-trained VGG16 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was the starting point for transfer learning.
Pump cavitation is predicted from raw 16,000 Hz accelerometer data. See below.

      <description>Signals ðŸ“¶ are everywhere. They are complex and change with time. Your heartbeat is a signal. So is pump vibration and the sound of your voice. Our ancestors used fires as light signals.
Below is my technical article.

      <description>On November 10, 2021, YouTube announced that video dislike ðŸ‘Ž counts would be hidden from the public. The stated benefit is protecting creators (especially smaller ones) from dislike attacks and harassment.
The number of dislikes is only available in YouTube Studio to content creators.
See the sentiment analysis below. It uses public comments scraped from the web and the DistillBERT language model. There are several visualizations like this histogram of sentiment.</description>

      <description>The internet is a cesspool of spy bots. Bots can attack an internet server hundreds of times a day. This Jupyter notebook, written in Python, visualizes bot attacks. It uses my anonymized server log and IP address geolocation.
The illustration and code are here:
